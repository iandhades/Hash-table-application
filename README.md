Introduction

A hash table is a data structure which stores keys and mapping values. A hash table uses a mapping function which finds the value of its corresponding key.
						
The hash function assign each key to a unique bucket. However, an imperfect hash function might cause hash collision which means the hash function has more than one key in the same index. Such collision must be solved.
						
In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average cost for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table. Many hash table has a constant average cost for insertion and deletions of key-value pairs.
